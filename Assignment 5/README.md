Assignment 5 consists of the following two files:
- trapezoid.py → Prompts the user to enter values for N, a, and b, and then uses the trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under the graph of f(x) from x = a to x = b with N intervals. The function f(x) is defined in the program.
- escape.py → Estimates the average distance a person dropped randomly in a square room will have to run to reach the nearest of three exits as well as the probability that the person will have to run less than 0.4 units to reach the nearest exit.
    - The square room is drawn on the Cartesian plane and has corners at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1) and exits at (0.2,0), (0,0.2), and (1,1). This program does not accept any user input.
