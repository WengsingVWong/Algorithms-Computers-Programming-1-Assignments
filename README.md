# Algorithms-Computers-Programming-1-Assignments
A repository containing programming assignments from Algorithms, Computers, and Programming I (MTH 3300).

On March 28, 2020, I uploaded Assignments 2 and 3. 

Assignment 2 consists of the following three files:
- population.py → Simulates three consecutive periods of population growth using three sets of user inputs (initial population, time period, and growth rate) and displays the results
- triangle.py → Asks the user for three positive numbers in descending order, and then calculates and displays the three angles of the triangle that has those three numbers as sidelengths using the Law of Cosines and the Law of Sines
- binary.py → Displays a random 8-digit binary number and its base-10 equivalent, and then displays the binary equivalent of a number between 0 and 255 based on the user's input

Assignment 3 consists of the following three files:
- quadratic.py → Solves a given quadratic equation using the quadratic formula and displays the solution(s), including complex solutions.
- tubwub.py → Determines whether the user should purchase tickets to a New York City event based on certain conditions, and if so, calculates the maximum number of tickets he/she can buy without exceeding $150.
  - In the assignment, this code is for a fictional company called TubWub, specifically for an app which will help people locate cheap admission tickets to nearby events.
- splitting.py → Asks the user for the X- and Y-coordinates of 4 points on a 2-D plane as well as the slope (m) and Y-intercept (b) of a line, and determines if the line splits the points evenly—that is, whether two points lie above the line and two points lie below the line.
