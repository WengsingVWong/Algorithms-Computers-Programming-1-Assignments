Assignment 2 consists of the following three files:
- population.py → Simulates three consecutive periods of population growth using three sets of user inputs (initial population, time period, and growth rate) and displays the results
- triangle.py → Asks the user for three positive numbers in descending order, and then calculates and displays the three angles of the triangle that has those three numbers as sidelengths using the Law of Cosines and the Law of Sines
- binary.py → Displays a random 8-digit binary number and its base-10 equivalent, and then displays the binary equivalent of a number between 0 and 255 based on the user's input
