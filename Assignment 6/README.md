Assignment 6 consists of the following two files:
- bricks.py → Prompts the user to enter integer values for x and y and then uses the <b>turtle</b> module to draw the corresponding picture of bricks. The picture has the following specifications:
    - There are 2*x rows, where the odd-numbered rows (counting from the top) have y bricks and the even-numbered rows have y + 1 bricks.
    - Each brick is 40 units wide and 20 units tall.
    - Adjacent rows are staggered such that the left and right edges of each brick are aligned with the middles of the bricks in the rows above and below.
- yield.py → Prompts the user to enter values for seven constants and then estimates the yield of a bond with three payments using Newton's Method.
